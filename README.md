# PupSense:

PupSense is a cutting-edge mobile application that leverages the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) to provide invaluable aid to our canine companions in case of an accident. By employing advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers, it effectively scrutinizes the unique audio properties of a dog's bark to discern any signs of distress arising from a mishap. Once the app identifies such an incident, it seamlessly updates the relevant data in Firebase, which subsequently triggers notifications to nearby app users and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). By displaying the precise locations of the closest veterinary hospitals on its interface, the app facilitates prompt and effective assistance to the injured dog, thereby advancing the noble cause of animal welfare.

# Problem Statement:

India grapples with a grave issue - it boasts the highest population of stray dogs globally. This crisis brings with it significant challenges, as hundreds of these canines succumb to road accidents each month, while thousands more suffer from debilitating injuries that often go untreated. Such incidents add to the already arduous existence of stray dogs, exacerbating their struggles and agony. Yet, as compassionate humans, we possess the power to extend a helping hand to these furry creatures in their time of need.

# Role of app:
PupSense application serves as a medium to make the coordination between NGO's and people of country meanwhile harnessing the best of IOT and ML/AI. Application captures realtime updates of any incident that is detected by the IOT device and presents them to user in a minimalistic yet powerful way. The simple UI of app makes it easy to understand and usable under urgent situations. Application also serves as a platform to increase awareness among Gen-Z regarding the problems of stray animals , inculcating a sense of compassion towards other creatures. Certainly! PupSense is further fortified by the formidable Firebase cloud backend, which provides exceptional reliability and scalability to the app. In summary, PupSense is a powerful tool that utilizes cutting-edge technology to facilitate assistance for stray animals, while also promoting awareness and compassion among its users.
